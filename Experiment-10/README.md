# Experiment 10: Logistic Regression

## Aim
Apply **Logistic Regression** for binary classification on the California Housing dataset, 
generate the **confusion matrix**, and calculate **accuracy**.  
This experiment also evaluates model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.  
Additionally, the confusion matrix is visualized to better understand classification results.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **California Housing Training Dataset** provided in Google Colab
