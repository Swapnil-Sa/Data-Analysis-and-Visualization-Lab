# Experiment 08: Encoding Categorical Variables

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to demonstrate how to convert categorical variables into **numerical form** using:  
- **Label Encoding** → Assigns a unique integer to each category.  
- **One-Hot Encoding** → Creates new binary columns (0/1) for each category.  

Encoding categorical data is an important preprocessing step in machine learning since most algorithms work only with numerical data.

## Dataset
A **sample dataset** is created with two categorical features:
- `Location` (e.g., New York, California, Texas)  
- `Type` (e.g., Apartment, Villa, Studio)  

## Steps Performed
1. Create a sample dataset with categorical variables.  
2. Apply **Label Encoding** to convert categories into integer values.  
3. Apply **One-Hot Encoding** to create binary indicator variables for each category.  
4. Compare results of both methods.
