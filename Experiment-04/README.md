# Experiment 04: Feature Scaling

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to normalize feature data using two commonly used scaling techniques: Min-Max Scaling and Standardization (Z-score scaling). Feature scaling is an essential preprocessing step in machine learning because:

- Different features in a dataset may have different ranges.

- Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the learning process, preventing bias toward higher-magnitude features.

- Min-Max Scaling transforms features into a fixed range (usually 0 to 1), while Standardization rescales data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of
