# Experiment 06: Data Visualization using Matplotlib

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to use **Matplotlib** for creating and saving different types of visualizations from the dataset.  
Visualization helps in understanding trends, distributions, and relationships within the dataset.  

Specifically, this experiment demonstrates:
- **Bar Charts** – to compare average values across categories.  
- **Line Graphs** – to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables.  
- **Pie Charts** – to show the proportion of categories in a dataset.  

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **California Housing Test Dataset** provided in Google Colab at:
