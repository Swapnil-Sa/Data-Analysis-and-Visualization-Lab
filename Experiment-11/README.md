# Experiment 11: K-Means Clustering

## Aim
Implement **K-Means clustering** to segment housing data into groups, 
determine the **cluster centroids**, and **visualize the results**.  
This experiment helps in understanding how unsupervised learning can 
group similar data points without using target labels.
