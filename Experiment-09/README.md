# Experiment 09: Linear Regression

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to **build and evaluate a simple Linear Regression model** using Scikit-learn on the California Housing dataset.  
The performance will be measured using the **RÂ² score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and the coefficients will be analyzed to understand feature importance.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **California Housing Training Dataset** provided in Google Colab at:
